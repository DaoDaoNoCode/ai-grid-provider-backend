// RetryOnConflict runs write, and runs it again while it fails with
// ErrConflict, at most ConflictAttempts times in all, like client-go's
// retry.RetryOnConflict. write must do the whole read-decide-write: take a
// new Head, make every check against it, and Commit on its revision. Then a
// rerun keeps every guarantee a single attempt gives, because a conflict on
// a file the caller depends on, such as the object it read at a version, is
// decided again on the new head and answered as it would have been without
// the race. Only a conflict on what the caller didn't depend on, such as an
// index file another object's write also changed, goes away.
//
// It returns write's last error: ErrConflict still, after the last attempt,
// or when ctx is done. Any other error ends it at once. It doesn't wait
// between attempts: each one fetches the branch again, and a conflict means
// another write was committed, so the next attempt starts from that one.
//
// Each rerun is logged, and so is giving up, so that writes racing on the
// repository show in the log although the caller sees none of the reruns.
